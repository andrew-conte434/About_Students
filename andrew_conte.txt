Hello, my name is Andrew Conte and I am a second-degree student at Brooklyn College. 
My first degree was in TV and Radio production but I decided to return to BC and pursue a career change after getting laid off at the start of the pandemic. 
My major is multimedia computing because at first I wanted to go into computer graphics but now I'm becoming more and more interested in machine learning so I may switch to computer science. 
My hobbies include lifting weights, chess, and video games. My favorite right now is Hearthstone and I want to also get into MTG Arena!
